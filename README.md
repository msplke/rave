## Description

- Rave is a mobile app that allows campus students to stay up-to-date on upcoming events happening across their own and other campuses. The app provides an easy-to-use interface that makes it simple for users to browse events by date, category, or location. Users can also receive event reminders, and share events with friends.
- Whether it's club meetings, parties, sports, games, cultural events, volunteer opportunities, or workshops, Rave is the go-to destination for students who want to stay connected and make the most of their campus experience.

## Project Structure

This project is based on the [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo) template repository, a monorepo built off the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg).

It uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and contains:

```

## Quickstart

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### 1. Setup dependencies

```diff
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# In packages/db/prisma update schema.prisma provider to use sqlite or use your own database provider
- provider = "postgresql"
+ provider = "sqlite"

# Configure environment variables.
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Prisma schema to your database
pnpm db:push
```

### 2. Configure Expo `dev`-script

#### Use iOS Simulator

1. Make sure you have XCode and XCommand Line Tools installed [as shown on Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/).
   > **NOTE:** If you just installed XCode, or if you have updated it, you need to open the simulator manually once. Run `npx expo start` in the root dir, and then enter `I` to launch Expo Go. After the manual launch, you can run `pnpm dev` in the root directory.

```diff
+  "dev": "expo start --ios",
```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

#### Use Android Emulator

1. Install Android Studio tools [as shown on Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).
2. Change the `dev` script at `apps/expo/package.json` to open the Android emulator.

```diff
+  "dev": "expo start --android",
```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

> **TIP:** It might be easier to run each app in separate terminal windows so you get the logs from each app separately. This is also required if you want your terminals to be interactive, e.g. to access the Expo QR code. You can run `pnpm --filter expo dev` and `pnpm --filter nextjs dev` to run each app in a separate terminal window.

## Project Status

🚧 **In Development** 🚧

Rave is currently _early_ in its development cycle. The app is not yet functional but is being actively developed. You may watch the project and leave a star to receive updates.
